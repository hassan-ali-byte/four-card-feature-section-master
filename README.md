## ⚙️ My Process  

### Built With  
- ✅ Semantic **HTML5 markup** (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`)

- 📐 **Responsive units** (`em`, `rem`, `clamp`) and **mobile-first workflow**  
- ⚡ **Flexbox + Grid** for card alignment and responsiveness

## 📚 What I Learned  

This challenge helped me improve in several key areas:  

- **CSS Styling with Pseudo-elements**  
  I practiced using the `::before` pseudo-element to create the colored top bars on each card.  
  This approach gave me more control compared to only using `box-shadow` and avoided issues with rounded corners.  

- **Responsive Layout**  
  Learned to combine **CSS Grid** for the main card arrangement and **Flexbox** inside cards for aligning content.
